# ICP — Ideal Customer Profile

## Primary persona: The Solo Indie Founder

### Who they are
- Solo founders or very early-stage builders (pre-product or just launched)
- Non-technical or semi-technical — can use tools but won't build their own pipeline
- Subscribe to 10-30+ newsletters (tech, indie hacking, SaaS, business)
- Mostly in the B2B micro-SaaS / indie hacker / bootstrapper ecosystem
- Active on Twitter/X, Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, Hacker News

### Demographics
- Age: 25-45
- Location: global, English-speaking (US, EU, UK, LATAM remote workers)
- Revenue: $0-$10k MRR (pre-revenue to early traction)
- Team size: 1 person (sometimes a co-founder, no employees)

### Their daily reality
- Subscribed to too many newsletters, read less than half
- Constantly looking for "what problem should I solve next?"
- Scroll Twitter threads and newsletters for market signals but it's manual and inconsistent
- Use Notion, spreadsheets, or just memory to track ideas
- Feel overwhelmed by information but afraid of missing a good signal

### Pain points we solve
1. **Information overload** — too many newsletters, not enough time to process them all
2. **No systematic way to extract value** — reading is passive, insights are lost
3. **Pattern recognition is manual** — they notice recurring problems sometimes, but inconsistently
4. **Idea validation is gut-feel** — no data to back "this problem keeps coming up"
5. **FOMO on unread newsletters** — guilt about not reading, fear of missing an opportunity

### What they want (desired outcome)
- A weekly digest of recurring problems and pain points from their newsletter stack
- Confidence that they're not missing important signals
- Data-backed validation that a problem is real and recurring
- Less time reading, more time building
- A shortcut from "I read a lot" to "I know what to build"

### How they describe the problem (voice of customer)
- "I subscribe to everything but read almost nothing"
- "I know there are good ideas buried in my newsletters"
- "I wish someone would just tell me what people keep complaining about"
- "I spend hours reading and still miss the patterns"
- "I need a system, not more bookmarks"

### Buying behavior
- Price-sensitive but willing to pay for clear time savings
- Free tier to try, upgrades when they see value in the first week
- Decides alone (no procurement, no team approval)
- Values simplicity over feature count
- Will churn if setup takes more than 10 minutes

### Where to reach them
- Twitter/X (indie hacker community, #buildinpublic)
- Indie Hackers forums and newsletters
- Product Hunt launches
- Hacker News (Show HN)
- Niche newsletters about newsletters (The Sample, Refind, etc.)
- Reddit: r/SideProject, r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, r/microsaas

## Anti-personas (who we don't target)

- **Enterprise teams** — need SSO, compliance, procurement cycles. Not our market now.
- **Agencies** — want white-label, multi-client. Not our architecture.
- **Casual readers** — subscribe to 2-3 newsletters and read them all. No pain point.
- **Data scientists** — would rather build their own pipeline. Too technical for our value prop.

## Key metrics to track

| Metric | Why it matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Time from signup to first analysis | Activation speed |
| Newsletters uploaded in first week | Engagement signal |
| Return visits to dashboard | Habit formation |
| Free-to-paid conversion rate | Value perception |
| Churn at month 2 | Sustained value vs novelty |

## Positioning summary

> For solo indie founders who subscribe to too many newsletters and miss the patterns hidden in them. Newsletter Mining turns unread emails into ranked product opportunities — so you spend less time reading and more time building the right thing.
